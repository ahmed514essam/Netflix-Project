<h1>What is Netflix?</h1>

<img src="imges/ooooooo.png" />

<p>Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows and movies on an internet-connected device.

    Depending on your plan, you can also download TV shows and movies to your Android phone or tablet, iPhone, iPad, or Google Chromebook device and watch without an internet connection.
    
    If you're already a member and would like to learn more about using Netflix, visit Getting started with Netflix.

<h2>TV Shows & Movies</h2>

<p>Netflix content varies by region and may change over time. You can watch a variety of award-winning Netflix originals, TV shows, movies, documentaries, and more.

    The more you watch, the better Netflix gets at recommending TV shows and movies.
    
    </p>

<h2>Supported Devices</h2>

<h2>Plans and Pricing</h2>

<img src="imges/fffffffffff.png" />
